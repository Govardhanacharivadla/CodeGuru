🎓 Proud to share CodeGuru - an open-source AI coding mentor!

After seeing developers struggle to truly understand code (not just copy-paste), I built CodeGuru to transform how we learn programming.

What makes it different?
🔹 Educational Focus: Explains WHAT, HOW, and WHY
🔹 Multi-Level Explanations: Simple → Detailed → Deep Dive
🔹 Interactive Q&A Chat: Ask any programming question
🔹 Multi-Language: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript
🔹 Privacy Options: Choose cloud (Groq) or local (Ollama)
🔹 100% Free & Open Source

Example: Instead of just "this is a decorator", CodeGuru teaches:
- What problem decorators solve
- How closures work underneath
- Common mistakes to avoid
- When to use them vs alternatives

Perfect for:
✅ Junior developers learning best practices
✅ Students understanding CS concepts
✅ Anyone reviewing unfamiliar code

## 📰 Reddit Post (r/programming, r/learnprogramming)

**Title:** I built CodeGuru - an AI that teaches you code instead of just explaining it

```markdown
Hey programmers!

I got tired of AI tools that give quick answers but don't help you actually learn. So I built **CodeGuru** - an open-source AI coding mentor focused on education.

## What it does differently

Instead of just telling you "this function does X", it teaches:
- 📚 **What**: Clear summary
- 🔧 **How**: Step-by-step breakdown
- 💡 **Why**: Design decisions and patterns
- 🎓 **Concepts**: CS principles being used
- ⚠️ **Pitfalls**: Common mistakes
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Industry standards

## Features
- Interactive Q&A chat mode
- Multi-language support (Python, Java, C++, JS, TS)
- Choose cloud (Groq - free) or local (Ollama)
- Export conversations to Markdown
- Auto-generate code diagrams

## Example

Ask: "How do async/await work?"

Traditional AI: "Async/await is syntactic sugar for promises..."

CodeGuru: Explains the event loop, compares to threading, shows real examples, points out common mistakes like mixing `time.sleep()` with `asyncio`, and links to related concepts.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- Groq API / Ollama
- Tree-sitter for code parsing
- Rich for beautiful CLI

GitHub: https://github.com/Govardhanacharivadla/CodeGuru

100% free and open source. Contributions welcome!

Would love feedback from the community! 🚀
